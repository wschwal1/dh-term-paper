## War on Their Minds: A Comparison of the Concepts Of "Democratization" and "War" in Chinese Newspapers, 1914-1949

**Description:**
The project *War on Their Minds* uses various computational methods to examine a database in which Chinese newspapers are stored. The aim of this study is to understand to what extent concepts related to democracy in Republic-era China were discussed in newspapers or whether other topics, such as war, predominated.

For this purpose, I examined 2,187 front pages of various Chinese newspapers from the period 1914 to 1949 using various methods such as web scraping and Python codes programmed for this purpose for certain keywords that are related to both "democracy" and "war". The results of this project and its documentation can be viewed in this space.
