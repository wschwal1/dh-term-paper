    "The period from 1911 to 1949 was a moving time of great upheaval, transformation, and uncertainty for China. In 1911 the monarchy was overthrown and a form of government that was thousands of years old was abolished. In their place came a modern nation-state, the first (and for a few decades the only) republic in East Asia. This was also a time of ongoing conflict, both internal and external. Internally, there was not only strife within the new rulers but also conflicts with warlords who were pursuing their own political and economic interests. In addition, there was initially a simmering conflict between political ideologies that ultimately escalated into full-scale war. And eventually Japan attacked China, leading to the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War.\n",

    "This article deals with the extent to which democratic concepts and the idea of democratization were reflected in Chinese newspapers. For this purpose, digital history methods are used to evaluate a large data set that could not be handled analogously. In the next section of this article, the methodology will be described in detail so that the reader can  get an idea of the possibilities of digital history methods and, moreover, to make this project as transparent as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "As explained below, the front pages of individual newspaper editions from the cities of Beijing and Nanjing in the period 1914 to 1949 were evaluated for this project. The available data sets were examined for search terms related to “democracy” and “war” in order to understand how these concepts determined reporting in Chinese newspapers and thus reflected the discourse within the Chinese population. It quickly became apparent that “war” was the predominant theme while “democracy” played a subordinated role. The reasons for this are obvious. As will be explained in detail below, there was no democratization of China; therefore, it was not an issue for the general population. War, on the other hand, affected the population directly and over a long period of time. Accordingly, Chinese reporting is dominated by this topic."
